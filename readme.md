# Advent of Code

This is the place to keep all answers for Advent of code.

Written in Typescript using Deno as a runtime for ease of use.

The rest will be a mini journal of the days. I do not expect to have time to
finish all puzzles this year, but we will see how far we get before family and
responsibilities catchup.

## Day 3 🔐

    This puzzle was not very hard but I am very unhappy with the complexity of the solutions. There are a lot of iterations over small arrays. While this should be okay, it is something that I would rather simplify.

## Day 2 🪨🗞️✂️

    This puzzle part 1 was fairly easy. But part 2 confused me a bit. It made me have to carefully evaluate the wins and loss strats and the point values. Also, deno complaining about indexing into the object type is something that I want to look closer at. The typing on this is fairly messy, but its late and I just want to be finished with it. :)

## Day 1

    Day 1 puzzles are always very easy warm ups. This was no exception. I was a little rusty on little things like sorting numbered arrays, but it was fairly straight forward.

## Setup

    Setup of Deno was surprisingly easy and without many issues. There was an odd module not found error that cleared itself and debugging took a minute to setup. However, to run these simple code snippets, Deno is great.
